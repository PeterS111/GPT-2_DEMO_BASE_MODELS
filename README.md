# GPT-2 Base Models Demo
version 10.12.2020

The code is based on https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2 by N Shepperd, with small changes by Peter S

This code allows to generate text from "Base" GPT-2 models - the models which were NOT fine-tuned. 

To run the code go to GPT_2_DEMO_BASE_MODELS.ipynb and hit "open in Colab".

If you want to experiment with fine-tuning the GPT-2 check out this repository:
